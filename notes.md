# Notes
### 5.1. [Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/wiki/Tri-3-TPT-0.1-related-to-Beneficial-and-Harmful-Effects-of-Computing-Big-Idea-5.1)

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
* Positive and Negative of a Information and Computers.  Today we have more information than ever, however, children no longer go outside and play without supervision.  Jobs and enjoyment are better and technology seems to advance society.  Yet, the news shows armies invading Ukraine and borders fortifying borders.
* Technology has produced a world economy.   However, today with people moving from nation to nation, means a small virus in a small town in China can cause the world to be paralyzed.  Tech in turn bails out the problem by producing a vaccine.
* Cars (gas), cars (electric), cars (autonomous) are revolutionizing transportation.  However, gas could destroy our planet.  Electric and Autonomous have great promises, but unforseen futures.

2. Dopamine Issues. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
* Code, Code, Code is a high and low situation for a Teacher.  Always having computer, always seeing new information...   It is a never ending struggle to become the perfect teacher.

### 5.2. [Digital Divide](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/wiki/Tri-3-TPT-0.2-related-to-Digital-Divide-Big-Idea-5.2)
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
* Back to Code, Code, Code;  this is the secret to so much tech and precision in tech.  Perpetual learning and now being able to retain and repeat that learning.  Adding your brain to the computer brain complementes the strength of biological with strengths of digital.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
* As Teachers, we are blessed with about 200 new minds to empower annually.  Also, trying to outreach to those that do not do CS with projects to complement and improve their Del Norte HS experience.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
* As CompSci Teachers, we are blocked by policies related to IT.   This goes from not being able to upgrade computers for students, to not being able to build labs for experiments, and not being able to preserve digital information produced by students.
